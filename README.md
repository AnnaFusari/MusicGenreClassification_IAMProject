# Music Genre Classification
<p>
  
The aim of the "Music Genre Classification" project is to analyze and classify a set of songs belonging to three different music genres by extracting audio features.
The first step involves collecting eighteen songs, equally distributed among the three genres, and then extracting both time-domain and frequency-domain audio features for each song.
The second step consists of dividing the data into two groups: the first group represents the training set, and the second group is the test set.
The k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) algorithm is used for classification.
